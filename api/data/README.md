# API Data Directory

This directory contains production JSON analysis files generated by the CodeCohesion processor.

## Usage

**Copy analysis files from processor:**

```bash
# From project root
cp processor/output/*.json api/data/
```

**Example:**

```bash
# Analyze a repository
cd processor
npm run dev -- ../path/to/repo

# Copy output to API data directory
cp output/repo-timeline-full.json ../api/data/
```

## File Format

The API supports both formats:
- **Static snapshots** - `repo-name.json`
- **Timeline V2** - `repo-name-timeline-full.json` (recommended)

## Test Fixtures

Test fixtures are located in `api/test/data/` and are NOT production data:
- `test-ecommerce-static.json` (84 KB)
- `test-ecommerce-timeline-full.json` (572 KB)

These fixtures are used for automated testing and local development.

## Git Ignore

Production JSON files (`*.json`) are gitignored. Only test fixtures in `api/test/data/` are committed to the repository.
