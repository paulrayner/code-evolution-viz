## ü§î Why CodeCohesion?

**Problem:** Understanding code architecture and cohesion is hard. Where are your bounded contexts? Which files are tightly coupled? How did your architecture evolve to its current state?

**Solution:** CodeCohesion turns git history into an interactive 3D visualization that reveals:
- üîó **Cohesion Patterns** - Which files belong together (bounded contexts)
- üî• **Coupling Hotspots** - Files that change together frequently
- üèóÔ∏è **Architecture** - Hierarchical structure at a glance
- ‚è≥ **Evolution** - How your codebase grew and changed over time
- üë• **Ownership** - Who works on what parts of the code

**Use Cases:**
- üìö **DDD & Bounded Contexts** - Discover natural domain boundaries through cohesion
- üîç **Monolith Decomposition** - Identify where to split based on temporal coupling
- üéì **Onboarding** - Give new team members a visual architectural tour
- üìΩÔ∏è **Retrospectives** - Watch timeline playback of how features evolved
- üí∞ **Technical Debt** - Find legacy hotspots and coupling issues

## üéØ Project Goals

Visualize code repositories to understand:
- **Repository structure** - Hierarchical organization at a glance
- **File relationships** - Parent-child connections and directory ownership
- **Code distribution** - File sizes mapped to lines of code
- **Recent activity** - See which files were recently modified
- **Team ownership** - Who last touched each file
- **File coupling** - Which files change together in commits

## ‚ú® Current Features

### Core Visualization
- **Solar System Layout** - Directories as planets, files as moons orbiting in 360¬∞ rings
- **Hierarchical Focus Mode** - Drill down into directories while maintaining context
- **Adaptive Sizing** - File sphere size represents lines of code, directories sized by total LOC
- **Smart Spacing** - Automatic layout prevents overlap using square-root scaling

### Interactive Exploration
- **Orbit Controls** - Left-click drag to rotate, right-click to pan, scroll to zoom
- **Click Navigation** - Click directories to focus, click again to navigate back up
- **Hover Highlighting** - Highlights files/directories and their ancestors on hover
- **Smooth Camera** - Stable camera framing without disorienting resets

### Git Metadata Visualization

#### Multiple Color Modes

Visualize the same codebase through different analytical lenses:

1. **File Type** (default) - 50+ file extensions with semantic color grouping
2. **Last Modified** - Adaptive time buckets showing recent changes
   - Active repos: 7 time intervals (last week ‚Üí 1-2 years)
   - Stale repos: Percentile-based intervals with year ranges
3. **Author** - Consistent hash-based colors per contributor
4. **Churn (Lifetime Commits)** - Heatmap showing frequently modified files
5. **Contributors (Lifetime)** - Number of unique contributors per file
6. **File Age** - When files were first created (new ‚Üí legacy)
7. **Recent Activity (90 days)** - Lines changed in recent window
8. **Code Stability** - Average lines changed per commit (stable ‚Üí volatile)
9. **Recency** - Days since last modification (hot ‚Üí cold)
10. **Lines of Code** - File size distribution with percentile-based buckets (small ‚Üí large)
11. **Coupling Clusters** - Files grouped by temporal coupling (change together)

![Churn Mode on React Repository](docs/images/churn-mode-react.png)
*React repository (6,784 files) colored by commit frequency - red spheres indicate high-churn hotspots that may need refactoring*

<details>
<summary>üì∏ More Color Mode Examples</summary>

![Recent Activity Mode](docs/images/activity-mode-cbioportal.png)
*cBioPortal repository with Recent Activity (90 days) coloring - shows which files have been actively developed*

![Last Modified Mode](docs/images/lastmod-mode-cbioportal.png)
*Same cBioPortal repository with Last Modified (Relative) coloring - reveals code age distribution from newest (green) to legacy (red)*

</details>

## üé® Design Decisions

### Solar System Metaphor
Directories are planets, files are moons. This provides:
- Clear visual ownership (files orbit their parent directory)
- Natural scaling (any number of children can orbit in a full 360¬∞ ring)
- Intuitive navigation (zoom into planets to see their moons)

### Hierarchical Focus Mode
Instead of showing the entire tree at once (which creates visual chaos), the system shows:
- **Initial view:** Root + first-level directories (overview)
- **Focused view:** Selected directory + its children + full ancestor chain
- **Context preservation:** Always see where you are in the hierarchy

### Adaptive Color Modes
Rather than hard-coded time intervals, the Last Modified mode adapts:
- **Active repos** (80% files changed in last 90 days): Fine-grained intervals
- **Stale repos** (80% files older than 90 days): Percentile-based buckets showing actual year ranges

### Radial Layout Algorithm
- Full 360¬∞ circles (no angular subdivision constraints)
- Orbit radius = 6 + sqrt(childCount) √ó 2.5 (prevents overlap while keeping files close)
- Vertical spacing = 12 units (clear parent-child relationship)
- Bounding box calculation for automatic camera framing

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Port 3000 already in use"**
```bash
# Vite will automatically try 3001, 3002, etc.
# Or manually kill the process:
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill
```

**"Module not found" errors**
```bash
# Clean install dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Viewer shows empty/broken visualization**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify JSON file is in `viewer/public/data/`
- Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Delete any `.js` files in `viewer/src/` (should only be `.ts`)

**Repository analysis crashes on large repos**
```bash
# Large repos may need more memory
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096 npm run dev -- /path/to/repo
```

**Stale compiled `.js` files causing issues**
```bash
# Remove compiled artifacts
cd viewer && rm src/*.js
```

**Timeline V2 changes not appearing**
- Hard refresh browser: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
- Delete `viewer/dist/` directory
- Restart Vite dev server
