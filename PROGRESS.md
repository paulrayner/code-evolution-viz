## Slice Status

### üöß Slice 1: View My Codebase Structure with File Sizes (IN PROGRESS)

**Goal:** Visualize repository structure at HEAD with file sizes and color-coded file types.

**Status:** Core features complete, additional git metadata visualization in progress

**Implemented Features:**

#### Core Visualization
- **Processor:** TypeScript-based repository analyzer
  - Reads git repositories at HEAD using simple-git
  - Calculates lines of code per file
  - Builds hierarchical tree structure
  - Exports to JSON format
  - Tested on Gource repository: 120 files, 28,011 LOC

- **Viewer:** Three.js-based 3D visualization
  - Solar system layout: directories as planets, files as orbiting moons
  - File size mapped to sphere diameter (0.3-2.0 units based on LOC)
  - Color coded by file extension (50+ types)
  - Interactive camera controls (orbit, zoom, pan via OrbitControls)

#### Layout & Spacing
- **Radial circle layout:** Each directory's children arranged in full 360¬∞ ring
- **Tight file orbits:** radius = 6 + sqrt(childCount) √ó 2.5 (~21 units for 35 files)
- **Moderate vertical spacing:** 12 units between parent and children
- **Hierarchical focus mode:** Show one subtree at a time to prevent overlap

#### Navigation & Focus
- **Initial view:** Root + first level directories only
- **Click to drill down:** Focus on directory to see its children
- **Context preservation:** Always show full ancestor chain + all siblings at ancestor levels
- **Click focused directory again:** Navigate back up to parent
- **Stable camera:** No disorienting resets during navigation

#### Visual Feedback
- **Hover highlighting:**
  - Files: Highlight file + all ancestor directories
  - Directories: Highlight directory + ancestors + all descendants
  - Emissive intensity 0.6 for highlighted nodes

- **Directory labels:** Floating CSS2D labels above each directory cube
- **Edges:** Lines connecting parents to children (visible for ownership)
- **Directory aggregation:**
  - Size by total LOC (0.8-3.0 scale)
  - Color by dominant file type in subtree

#### Color Scheme
- **Comprehensive palette:** 50+ file types with semantic grouping
  - Source code: Distinct bright colors (C++ pink, Python blue, JS yellow, etc.)
  - Markup: HTML orange, CSS blue, Markdown blue
  - Shaders: GLSL teal
  - Build/config: Warm colors (Automake orange, YAML red)
  - Data: JSON dark, text gray
  - Assets: Images magenta, fonts dark gray
- **Single source of truth:** `viewer/src/colorScheme.ts`
- **Zero unknown files:** All 120 Gource files have explicit colors

#### UI Panels
- **Header:** Repository name, commit hash, date, file count, total LOC
- **Stats Panel (collapsible):**
  - Total files, total LOC, directory count, max depth
  - Top 5 languages with color-coded bar charts
  - Positioned bottom-right (non-blocking)
  - Click header to collapse/expand

- **Info Panel:** File/directory details on click
  - Files: path, LOC, extension
  - Directories: path, total LOC, file count, subdirectory count, dominant type

- **Legend (collapsible):**
  - Shows file types present in current repository
  - Sorted by frequency
  - Click header to collapse/expand

- **Tooltip:** Hover shows node name and quick stats
- **Controls hint:** Bottom-center instructions

#### Technical Architecture
- **Viewer structure:**
  - `TreeVisualizer.ts`: Core 3D rendering and interaction
  - `main.ts`: UI population and data loading
  - `colorScheme.ts`: Centralized color definitions
  - `types.ts`: Shared type definitions

- **Key algorithms:**
  - Radial tree layout with adaptive spacing
  - Fibonacci sphere distribution (implemented but not used)
  - Bounding box calculation for camera framing

### Remaining Work for Slice 1

**Bug Fixes:**
- **Fix directory sizing calculation** - Currently normalizing against max file LOC instead of max directory LOC, causing large directories to appear same size

**Git Metadata Collection:**

Enhance processor to collect per-file metrics using `git log --follow --format="%ai|%an|%H" -- <filepath>`

#### High Priority Metrics

**1. Last Modified Date**
- **Collection:** Parse most recent commit timestamp from git log
- **Storage:** ISO timestamp string
- **Legend display:** Time ranges with gradient colors
  - üü¢ "Last 24 hours" (bright green #00ff88)
  - üü° "Last week" (yellow-green #a4dd00)
  - üü† "Last month" (orange #ff9500)
  - üî¥ "Last 3 months" (red-orange #ff4444)
  - ‚ö´ "Older than 3 months" (gray #666666)
- **Calculation:** `now - lastModifiedDate` in days, bucketed by range

**2. Last Commit Author**
- **Collection:** Parse author name from most recent commit
- **Storage:** String (author name)
- **Legend display:** Dynamic list of authors present in visible files
  - "Alice Johnson" (color: #3498db - hashed from name)
  - "Bob Smith" (color: #e74c3c)
  - "Carol White" (color: #2ecc71)
  - ... (up to 10 authors shown, then "Others")
- **Color assignment:** Hash author name ‚Üí consistent HSL color (60-300¬∞ hue, 70% saturation, 60% lightness)
- **Note:** Ensures same author always gets same color across repositories

**3. Commit Frequency (Churn)**
- **Collection:** Count total commits in `git log --follow -- <filepath>`
- **Storage:** Integer count
- **Legend display:** Heatmap with quantile-based buckets
  - ‚ùÑÔ∏è "Low churn (1-5 commits)" (cool blue #3498db)
  - üå§Ô∏è "Moderate (6-15 commits)" (yellow #f39c12)
  - üî• "High (16-50 commits)" (orange #e67e22)
  - üî•üî• "Very high (51+ commits)" (red #e74c3c)
- **Calculation:** Parse line count from `git log --follow --oneline -- <filepath> | wc -l`
- **Normalization:** Use repository-specific quantiles (25th, 50th, 75th, 95th percentile) to determine buckets
- **Interpretation:** High churn = potential refactoring target or critical hotspot

**4. Unique Contributors**
- **Collection:** Count distinct authors from `git log --follow --format="%an" -- <filepath> | sort -u | wc -l`
- **Storage:** Integer count
- **Legend display:** Discrete color scale
  - üü¶ "Solo (1 contributor)" (blue #3498db)
  - üü© "Pair (2 contributors)" (green #2ecc71)
  - üü® "Team (3-4 contributors)" (yellow #f1c40f)
  - üüß "Squad (5-9 contributors)" (orange #e67e22)
  - üü• "Many (10+ contributors)" (red #e74c3c)
- **Interpretation:** Higher count = more coordination needed, potential ownership ambiguity

**5. File Age**
- **Collection:** Parse oldest commit timestamp from `git log --follow --reverse --format="%ai" -- <filepath> | head -1`
- **Storage:** ISO timestamp string
- **Legend display:** Time ranges with gradient
  - üåü "New (<3 months)" (bright cyan #00d9ff)
  - üíé "Recent (3-12 months)" (blue #3498db)
  - üìò "Mature (1-3 years)" (purple #9b59b6)
  - üìï "Old (3-5 years)" (brown #795548)
  - üèõÔ∏è "Legacy (5+ years)" (dark gray #34495e)
- **Calculation:** `now - firstCommitDate` in days, converted to months/years
- **Interpretation:** Helps distinguish new code from legacy systems

#### Medium Priority Metrics

**6. Recent Change Magnitude**
- **Collection:** Parse stats from `git log -1 --numstat --format="" -- <filepath>`
- **Storage:** Object `{ added: number, deleted: number, total: number }`
- **Legend display:** Size-based buckets
  - üìù "Tiny change (1-10 lines)" (light blue #ecf0f1)
  - üìÑ "Small change (11-50 lines)" (blue #3498db)
  - üìã "Medium change (51-200 lines)" (yellow #f39c12)
  - üìö "Large change (201-500 lines)" (orange #e67e22)
  - üèóÔ∏è "Massive change (500+ lines)" (red #e74c3c)
- **Calculation:** `added + deleted` from numstat output
- **Interpretation:** Shows impact of most recent modification

**7. Commit Message Keywords**
- **Collection:** Parse last 10 commit messages with `git log -10 --format="%s" -- <filepath>`
- **Storage:** Array of detected keywords `['fix', 'refactor']`
- **Legend display:** Categorical with semantic colors
  - ‚úÖ "Clean (no signals)" (green #2ecc71)
  - üîß "Maintenance (refactor, update)" (blue #3498db)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è "Issues (fix, bug, workaround)" (yellow #f39c12)
  - üö® "Problems (hack, TODO, FIXME)" (red #e74c3c)
- **Keyword categories:**
  - Clean: No keywords detected
  - Maintenance: "refactor", "update", "improve", "cleanup", "optimize"
  - Issues: "fix", "bug", "resolve", "correct", "patch"
  - Problems: "hack", "workaround", "temporary", "TODO", "FIXME", "broken"
- **Priority:** If multiple categories present in recent commits, show worst one (Problems > Issues > Maintenance > Clean)
- **Interpretation:** Code health indicator based on recent development activity

**8. Branch Activity**
- **Collection:** Count commits per branch with `git log --all --format="%D" -- <filepath>`
- **Storage:** Object `{ main: number, feature: number, total: number }`
- **Legend display:** Ratio-based categories
  - üéØ "Stable (0% feature branches)" (dark blue #2c3e50)
  - üìä "Balanced (1-25% feature)" (blue #3498db)
  - üîÄ "Active (26-50% feature)" (yellow #f39c12)
  - ‚ö° "Experimental (51-75% feature)" (orange #e67e22)
  - üöÄ "Volatile (76-100% feature)" (red #e74c3c)
- **Calculation:** `(featureBranchCommits / totalCommits) * 100`
- **Branch detection:** Parse branch names from refs, classify as main (main/master/develop) vs feature (everything else)
- **Interpretation:** High % = rapid iteration/experimentation, low % = stable production code

**Visualization Features:**

**Color Mode Switching:**
- Add dropdown selector in header with 9 modes:
  1. File type (current default)
  2. Last modified date
  3. Last commit author
  4. Commit frequency (churn)
  5. Unique contributors
  6. File age
  7. Recent change magnitude
  8. Commit message keywords
  9. Branch activity
- Legend automatically updates based on selected mode
- Directory colors inherit from dominant child value (e.g., highest churn file, most recent modification)
- Mode preference persisted in localStorage

**Label Display Toggle:**
- Add button next to color mode selector: "Labels: Always On / Hover Only"
- Always On: Current behavior (CSS2D labels above all directories)
- Hover Only: Labels only appear when hovering over directory or its files
- Preference persisted in localStorage
- Helps reduce visual clutter for large repositories

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- All git metadata collected during processor analysis phase
- Output JSON schema updated with new fields per file
- Viewer reads metadata and applies color based on selected mode
- Color calculations done in `colorModeManager.ts` module
- Fallback colors for missing data (e.g., files with no git history)

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Solar System Metaphor:** Directories as planets, files as moons
   - Clear visual ownership
   - Prevents overlap through hierarchical focus
   - Scales to any directory size

2. **Hierarchical Focus Mode:** Show one subtree at a time
   - Initial view: Overview (root + level 1)
   - Click to drill down: Focus + context (ancestors + siblings at ancestor levels)
   - Prevents visual clutter
   - Maintains spatial stability

3. **Color Coding:** Semantic grouping by file purpose
   - Source code: Bright, distinct colors
   - Build/config: Warm colors
   - Assets: Magenta family
   - 50+ explicit types, zero unknowns

4. **Radial Layout:** Full 360¬∞ circle per directory
   - No angular subdivision constraints
   - Simple, predictable spacing
   - Works with focus mode

5. **Adaptive Spacing:** Based on child count
   - Tight orbits: sqrt scaling keeps files close
   - Moderate vertical: Clear parent-child relationship
   - 12 units vertical spacing

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Incremental approach:** Building Slice 1 completely before moving on
2. **User feedback loop:** Iterative UX improvements based on testing
3. **Solar system metaphor:** Intuitive and scales well
4. **Focus mode:** Elegant solution to overlap problem
5. **Color scheme refactoring:** Single source of truth prevented bugs

### Challenges Overcome
1. **File overlap in dense directories:**
   - Initial: Angular subdivision crushed files together
   - Solution: Full 360¬∞ circles + hierarchical focus mode

2. **Visual clutter:**
   - Initial: All subtrees visible = chaos
   - Solution: Focus mode with ancestor context preservation

3. **Disorienting navigation:**
   - Initial: Camera resets on focus change
   - Solution: Stable camera position

4. **Stats panel blocking view:**
   - Initial: Top-right placement overlapped visualization
   - Solution: Moved to bottom-right, made collapsible

### Open Questions
1. How to handle repositories with 1000+ files?
2. Performance optimization for large trees?
3. Alternative layouts for very deep hierarchies?
4. Multi-ring layout for extremely dense directories?
