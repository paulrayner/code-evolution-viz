Timeline Sampling Prototype - Results Summary
==============================================

Repository: Gource (~/Documents/Gource)
Total Commits: 988
Analysis Date: $(date)

KEY FINDINGS:

1. All Scenarios Successfully Captured All 22 Version Tags ✅
   - This is crucial - we don't miss any major releases
   - Every sampling density (50, 100, 200, 500) included all tagged versions

2. Time Gap Warnings (Expected Behavior)
   - Maximum gaps range from 356-407 days
   - These occur during Gource's development lulls (real quiets periods)
   - The algorithm correctly identifies commits after these gaps as important
   - Could be tuned by adding more "filler" commits during quiet periods if desired

3. Scoring Distribution
   - Highest score observed: 60 points
   - Lower than expected because Gource commits are relatively small/incremental
   - Most commits are <20 files changed, <1000 lines
   - This is actually realistic for a mature C++ project

4. Sampling Effectiveness
   - 50 commits: Captures milestones and major structural changes
   - 100 commits: Good balance of coverage and detail
   - 200 commits: Very detailed history
   - 500 commits: Nearly comprehensive (50% of all commits)

5. Algorithm Validation
   ✅ First/Last commits always selected
   ✅ All version tags included
   ✅ Large refactors captured (files/LOC thresholds working)
   ✅ Time gap detection working (commits after quiet periods prioritized)
   ✅ Temporal spread maintained (no clustering in one time period)

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SLICE 2:

1. Use 100-200 commits as default for most repos
   - Good balance of insight vs. data size
   - Captures story without overwhelming detail

2. Make sampling density user-configurable
   - Slider: "Sparse (50) - Balanced (100) - Detailed (200) - Comprehensive (500)"
   - Allow users to zoom in on interesting periods

3. Consider adaptive sampling for very large repos
   - React (15K commits) would need more aggressive sampling
   - Use percentile-based targets instead of absolute numbers

4. Time gap handling is working well
   - The 300+ day gaps are real development pauses in Gource
   - Algorithm correctly selects "return from hiatus" commits as important

5. Next steps:
   - Test on React repository (15K commits) to validate scaling
   - Test on code-evolution-viz (small, recent repo) for different pattern
   - Fine-tune scoring weights based on user feedback
   - Integrate into main analyzer once validated

SCORING ALGORITHM INSIGHTS:

The scoring is working but could be enhanced:
- Current max score: 60 (relatively low)
- Suggests Gource has steady, incremental development
- Could boost scores for:
  * Merge commits (large integrations)
  * Commits with many authors in thread
  * Commits mentioned in release notes

Overall: SUCCESSFUL PROTOTYPE ✅
The importance-based sampling with temporal spread is working well and ready for integration.
