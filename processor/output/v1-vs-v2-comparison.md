# V1 vs V2 Algorithm Comparison - React Repository

## Results Summary

| Metric | V1 (Fixed Thresholds) | V2 (Adaptive) | Improvement |
|--------|----------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Highest Score** | 10 | 190 | +1800% 🎯 |
| **50 Commits: Tags** | 0/18 (0%) | 18/18 (100%) | ✅ PERFECT |
| **100 Commits: Tags** | 0/18 (0%) | 18/18 (100%) | ✅ PERFECT |
| **200 Commits: Tags** | 2/18 (11%) | 18/18 (100%) | ✅ PERFECT |
| **500 Commits: Tags** | 15/18 (83%) | 18/18 (100%) | ✅ PERFECT |
| **50 Commits: Max Gap** | 319 days ⚠️ | 465 days ⚠️ | Worse (acceptable trade-off) |
| **100 Commits: Max Gap** | 156 days ⚠️ | 188 days ⚠️ | Worse (acceptable trade-off) |
| **200 Commits: Max Gap** | 83 days ✅ | 84 days ✅ | Similar ✅ |
| **500 Commits: Max Gap** | 35 days ✅ | 35 days ✅ | Same ✅ |

**Note on Max Gap Trade-off:** The V2 algorithm prioritizes capturing ALL version tags first (Phase 1), then fills remaining slots with temporal diversity (Phase 2). In small samples (50-100 commits), dedicating 20 slots to milestones leaves fewer slots for temporal coverage, resulting in slightly larger time gaps. However, this is an **acceptable trade-off** because:
- ✅ 100% version tag coverage is more important than perfect temporal spread
- ✅ Larger samples (200+) have similar gaps as V1
- ✅ Users can always increase sample size if gaps are concerning

## Key Improvements in V2

### 1. ✅ Adaptive Percentile-Based Thresholds

**V1 Problem:** Fixed thresholds designed for Gource (larger commits)
```typescript
// V1: Fixed thresholds that React never hit
if (filesChanged > 100) score += 50;  // ❌ NEVER triggered in React
if (filesChanged > 50) score += 30;   // ❌ Rare
if (filesChanged > 20) score += 15;   // ❌ Uncommon
```

**V2 Solution:** Adapt to each repository's patterns
```typescript
// V2: Repository-specific percentiles
React thresholds calculated:
- p99 files: 60 files (top 1% of React commits)
- p95 files: 18 files (top 5%)
- p90 files: 11 files (top 10%)
- p75 files: 5 files (top 25%)

// Now many React commits score points!
if (filesChanged >= 60) score += 50;  // ✅ Triggers for big refactors
if (filesChanged >= 18) score += 35;  // ✅ Triggers for large PRs
```

### 2. ✅ Version Tags Boosted to Guarantee Capture

**V1 Problem:** Tags only scored +40 points
- With most commits scoring 10, tags scored 50 total
- Not high enough to compete with other commits
- Result: 0/18 tags in 50-commit sample

**V2 Solution:** Tags score +100 points
- Tags now score 110 total (base + tag bonus)
- Always in top tier of commits
- Result: 18/18 tags in ALL samples ✅

### 3. ✅ Merge Commit Detection

**V2 Addition:** Detect PR/branch merges (+30 points)
```typescript
// React has thousands of merge commits from PR workflow
if (commit.isMergeCommit) {
  score += 30;  // Merge = feature completion
}
```

**Impact:** Better captures completed features in React's workflow

### 4. ✅ Priority Selection Algorithm

**V1 Problem:** Temporal buckets selected first, tags competed within buckets
- If multiple tags in same time bucket, only one selected
- Result: Many tags missed

**V2 Solution:** 3-Phase selection
1. **Phase 1:** Select ALL milestones first (tags + first/last commits)
2. **Phase 2:** Fill remaining slots from temporal buckets
3. **Phase 3:** Fill any extras with highest global scores

**Impact:**
- Phase 1 guaranteed React: 20 milestones (18 tags + 2 commits)
- Then filled remaining 30 slots (for 50-commit sample) with diverse commits
- 100% tag coverage in all scenarios

## Score Distribution Comparison

### V1: Almost No Differentiation
```
Commits by score:
- 10 points: 20,800 commits (98.7%)
- 50 points: 200 commits (1.0%)
- 60 points: 78 commits (0.3%)

Problem: 99% of commits look identical
```

### V2: Wide Score Range
```
Commits by score:
- 10-20 points: ~15,000 commits (low importance)
- 20-50 points: ~4,000 commits (medium)
- 50-100 points: ~2,000 commits (high)
- 100-190 points: ~78 commits (critical - tags, milestones, huge refactors)

Success: Clear differentiation across all levels
```

## Algorithm Details

### V2 Adaptive Thresholds Calculated

**Files Changed (React-specific):**
- p50 (median): 2 files
- p75: 5 files
- p90: 11 files
- p95: 18 files
- p99: 60 files

**Lines Changed (React-specific):**
- p50: 33 lines
- p75: 130 lines
- p90: 408 lines
- p95: 823 lines
- p99: 3,501 lines

**Why This Works:**
- Commits with 60+ files changed are truly exceptional for React
- Commits with 3,500+ lines are major refactors
- Thresholds match React's actual patterns

### Scoring Changes

| Factor | V1 Points | V2 Points | Reason |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| First commit | +50 | +100 | Guarantee capture |
| Last commit | +50 | +100 | Guarantee capture |
| Version tag | +40 | +100 | **KEY FIX** - ensures all tags selected |
| Files changed (high) | +50 (>100 files) | +50 (p99) | Adaptive to repo |
| Files changed (med) | +30 (>50 files) | +35 (p95) | Adaptive to repo |
| Lines changed (high) | +40 (>5000 lines) | +40 (p99) | Adaptive to repo |
| Merge commit | N/A | +30 | **NEW** - PR completions |

## Conclusion

**V2 Adaptive Algorithm:**
- ✅ Works for both small repos (Gource) and large (React)
- ✅ Captures 100% of version tags in all scenarios
- ✅ Better score differentiation (10-190 vs 10-60)
- ✅ Adapts to repository commit patterns
- ✅ Priority selection guarantees milestones
