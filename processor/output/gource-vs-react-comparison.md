## Key Findings

### ✅ What Worked Well

1. **Processing Time: Acceptable for both repos**
   - Gource (988 commits): ~2-3 minutes
   - React (21K commits): ~10-15 minutes
   - Scalability confirmed: Can handle very large repos

2. **Temporal Spread: Working**
   - Both repos show good time distribution
   - No clustering in specific periods
   - Time gap detection functioning

3. **Data Size: Manageable**
   - HTML report generation works for both
   - Browser can render 21K commit timeline

### ⚠️ Problems Identified

1. **Low Score Differentiation in React**
   - Highest score: only 10 points
   - Most commits score exactly 10 (base score only)
   - Why: React commits are VERY small and incremental
     - Most commits: <5 files changed
     - Most commits: <100 LOC changed
     - Thresholds (20 files, 500 LOC) rarely met

2. **Version Tags Missing in Small Samples**
   - React 50/100 commit samples miss ALL version tags
   - Only 500-commit sample gets 83% coverage
   - Why: Version tag commits don't score high enough
   - Current: Tags get +40 points (40 + 10 base = 50 max)
   - Problem: With so many commits scoring 10, tags don't stand out

3. **Score Distribution Problem**
   ```
   Gource:
   - Scores range: 10-60
   - Good spread for selection
   
   React:
   - Scores: 99% are exactly 10
   - Almost no differentiation
   - Random selection among equals
   ```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why React Scores So Low

**React's Development Pattern:**
- Facebook engineers commit VERY frequently
- Commits are atomic and tiny (single function changes)
- Large refactors broken into 100s of small commits
- Result: No individual commit looks "important"

**Current Algorithm Assumptions:**
- Large LOC changes = important ❌ (Not true for React)
- Many files changed = important ❌ (Not true for React)  
- Version tags = important ✅ (But not weighted enough)
- Time gaps = important ⚠️ (React has continuous development)

### Scoring Thresholds Too High

```typescript
// Current thresholds (designed for Gource-style repos)
if (filesChanged > 100) score += 50;  // NEVER hit in React
else if (filesChanged > 50) score += 30;  // Rare
else if (filesChanged > 20) score += 15;  // Uncommon

if (linesChanged > 5000) score += 40;  // NEVER hit
else if (linesChanged > 1000) score += 20;  // Rare
```

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. **Adaptive Thresholds (Percentile-Based)**

Instead of fixed thresholds, use repository-specific percentiles:

```typescript
// Calculate during analysis
const stats = {
  p50_filesChanged: 3,    // Median: 3 files
  p75_filesChanged: 8,    // 75th: 8 files  
  p90_filesChanged: 25,   // 90th: 25 files
  p95_filesChanged: 60,   // 95th: 60 files
  p99_filesChanged: 150,  // 99th: 150 files
  
  p50_linesChanged: 50,
  p75_linesChanged: 150,
  p90_linesChanged: 500,
  p95_linesChanged: 1500,
  p99_linesChanged: 5000
};

// Score relative to repo
if (commit.filesChanged >= stats.p99_filesChanged) score += 50;
else if (commit.filesChanged >= stats.p95_filesChanged) score += 30;
else if (commit.filesChanged >= stats.p90_filesChanged) score += 15;
```

**Result:** Would differentiate React commits much better

### 2. **Boost Version Tag Score Dramatically**

```typescript
// Current
if (commit.tags.length > 0) score += 40;  // Not enough!

// Proposed
if (commit.tags.length > 0) score += 100;  // Guaranteed top priority
```

**Result:** ALL version tags captured even in 50-commit sample

### 3. **Add Merge Commit Detection**

```typescript
// React has thousands of merge commits (PR merges)
if (commit.parents.length > 1) {
  score += 25;  // Merge commits = feature completions
}
```

### 4. **Detect "Refactor Clusters"**

```typescript
// When many small commits happen together on same files/dirs
// Consider them as a single "large change"
if (isPartOfRefactorCluster(commit)) {
  score += 30;
}
```

### 5. **Dynamic Sampling Targets**

```typescript
// Adjust target based on repo size
const targetCommits = Math.min(
  500,  // Never more than 500
  Math.max(
    50,   // Never fewer than 50
    Math.floor(totalCommits * 0.05)  // 5% of total
  )
);

// React: 21K * 0.05 = 1,050 → capped at 500
// Gource: 988 * 0.05 = 49 → raised to 50
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Implement percentile-based thresholds**
   - Calculate stats during first pass
   - Apply adaptive scoring in second pass

2. **Boost version tag scores to 100+**
   - Ensures milestones never missed

3. **Add merge commit detection**
   - Quick win for React-style repos

### Testing

1. Re-run on React with new algorithm
2. Validate ALL version tags captured in 50-commit sample
3. Check score distribution improves (wider range)

### Future Enhancements

1. Detect commit clusters (related changes)
2. Author diversity scoring (first-time contributors)
3. CI/CD signals (commits that break/fix builds)
4. Commit message sentiment analysis

## Conclusion

**Current Algorithm:**
- ✅ Works well for traditional repos (Gource)
- ⚠️ Struggles with high-frequency repos (React)
- Root cause: Fixed thresholds don't adapt to repo patterns

**Solution:**
- Adaptive, percentile-based scoring
- Higher weight for guaranteed milestones (tags)
- Merge commit detection

**Expected Outcome:**
- Both Gource AND React sampled intelligently
- 100% version tag coverage in all scenarios
- Better differentiation in high-frequency repos
